Document your design system easily

Try it out, head to [the demo](https://jenil.github.io/doction/?storage=local) and click "Edit" on the top bar.

## Getting Started

Easiest way to get started at the moment is by forking this repo and edit the `_config.yml` to change the name and save it. Your documentation website should then be live on GitHub Pages at `<username>.github.io/doction`

## Run locally

Follow the [installation instruction](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) for Github Pages, then run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```
